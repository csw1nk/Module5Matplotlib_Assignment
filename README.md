### Analysis

- Strong Correlation Between Weight and Tumor Volume: There is a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume in the Capomulin regimen. This suggests that heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes. The scatter plot and linear regression model supports this by showing weight of the mouse increases so does the average tumor volume - upward line.

- Effectiveness of Capomulin and Ramicane: When comparing the summary statistics chart, both Capomulin and Ramicane have lower mean and median tumor volumes compared to the other drug regimens listed. This could indicate a higher effectiveness of these treatments in reducing tumor size.

- Potential Outliers in Infubinol Treatment: In the box plot distribution, Infubinol has a potential outlier, which is a data point that falls below the lower bound of the box plot's whiskers. This suggests that there might be a mouse or mice providing very different numbers than the rest.
